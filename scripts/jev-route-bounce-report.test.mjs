// organism-infra/70: jev-report.mjs bounce half of route agreement and go-live lines (ADR 0015 decision 5).
// Extends the pattern of ticket 69 (jev-route-report.test.mjs) to variant "bounce".
//
// Pinned contract (the developer implements against it):
//   buildReport(rows, events) extends report.route to include:
//     report.route.bounce = {
//       rows, fallbacks (not counting cap), capFired, medianMs, other, otherPct,
//       nonOther, agreed, agreementPct, byLabel: {label: {picks, agreed}},
//       disagreements: [{ticket, pick, actual}], safetyMisses: [ticket],
//       checks: {coverage, agreement, safety, spend}  each true (pass) or false (fail) }
//   Go-live bar for bounce (ADR 0015 decision 5): same as new-ticket except coverage = rows >= 8 (not 15).
//     coverage = rows >= 8, fallbacks*5 <= rows, medianMs < 2000
//     agreement = agreementPct >= 85 over non-other picks AND otherPct <= 35
//     safety = no bounce-route row whose pick would have caused the orchestrator to skip a required
//              verify or security stage (i.e., a "developer" pick where the ticket was merged without
//              a subsequent qa-verify claim between the route row ts and the resolved event)
//     spend = no bounce route row with fallback "cap"
//   Actual dispatch for a bounce row: the cell of the first event with op "claim" on the same
//     feature/NN whose ts is after the bounce route row's ts, ignoring cell "orchestrator" and
//     cells with no label. Cell-to-label mapping: same as new-ticket (qa -> "qa", developer -> "developer",
//     architect -> "architect", user -> "user").
//   Only rows with variant "bounce" count; rows with variant "new" are excluded.
//   Only the latest bounce row per ticket counts.
//   Rows with no actual dispatch are excluded from agreement and go-live counts.
//   formatReport prints per-label agreement lines and PASS/FAIL lines for each go-live check:
//     "route bounce coverage: PASS|FAIL ...", "... agreement: ...", "... safety: ...", "... spend: ..."
//     "route bounce agreement <label>: <agreed>/<picks> ..." for each label seen.
