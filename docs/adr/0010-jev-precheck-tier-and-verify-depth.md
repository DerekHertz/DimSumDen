# Jev pre-checks pick a developer model tier and a qa verify depth, in shadow mode first

**Status:** accepted (2026-09-28: decisions 1-12 of the grill in `.scratch/organism-infra/issues/04-jev-precheck-design.md`). Implementation is gated: adding an SDK dependency (if `fetch` is not enough) and the `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` each need the user's explicit yes. `security` reviews the Data exposure section. **Amended** 2026-10-05: trials replace shadow and exit review; tier retuned; verify's fallback is today's rule (Amendment 1, at the end).

**Context.** The goal is near 24/7 work inside the 5-hour and weekly Claude limits (ADR 0002). Two relay decisions are made by the orchestrator's own judgment today: which model a developer needs, and how hard qa verify must look. Both are cheap classification over text the orchestrator already holds. Jev (TypeSafe's typed-decision model) answers such questions in about 100 ms at $0.042 per million input tokens, output free (secondary sources, `refs/jev-engineering-notes.md`; our own numbers come from shadow mode). Jev bills on API credits, not the subscription, so it is a small metered cost beside plan limits, not a way around them. ADR 0001 forbids calling the *Claude* API from the office and the cells stay unmodified `claude` CLI processes; Jev is a different vendor and never runs a cell, so 0001 is not contradicted. ADR 0004 (OS-agnostic) holds: the script is plain Node with no shell.

**Decision.**

1. **What Jev decides, and what stays out.**
   - *Developer model tier* (point `tier`): `sonnet` or `opus`.
   - *qa verify depth* (point `verify`): `light` or `full`.
   - Not Jev's: security review depth (`risk-check` still gates it, ADR 0009 / ticket 08), tool routing (ticket 37 trims `tools:` lists), dispatch routing, board triage, scout filtering, the wake-up check, and parallel threads (wait for a shadow-mode throughput baseline). Later candidates from `jev-engineering-notes.md` are weighed only after shadow results.

2. **Invocation: a script, not a cell, MCP server or skill.** `node scripts/jev.mjs`, run by the orchestrator. Costs no context tokens, is not an LLM cell, is testable, and has one owner of the key. One script with two points, not two scripts: cap, redaction, fallback and logging live once (deletion test: two scripts would copy all four).

3. **Interface.**
   ```
   node scripts/jev.mjs <tier|verify> --ticket <feature>/<NN-slug> [--tests <path>] [--mode shadow|live]
   ```
   - *Inputs* (the script assembles them; the caller passes references): `tier`: the ticket markdown (What to build, criteria, Comments scope). `verify`: the same, plus the developer's test output file at `--tests`. Nothing else is read or sent. Text over 16k characters is tail-truncated. Diff metadata (paths, line counts, risk-check categories) is **not** an input in shadow mode; the exit review may propose it.
   - *Call points, once each per ticket.* `tier`: right before the developer dispatch. `verify`: right before qa verify dispatch, after the developer's tests were run.
   - *Questions* (one judgment each, `other` exit on every Choice, all in one call, per the Jev rules in `jev-engineering-notes.md`): `tier` asks `standard | hard | other`; `hard` means the ticket spans several modules or a lock, race or migration concern, or its spec is ambiguous. `verify` asks `light | full | other`; `light` only when the test output shows every test passing with none skipped and the ticket adds no new behavior beyond its listed criteria. The rubric text lives in the script; the model is pinned (`jev-1.13.0`).
   - *Output*: one JSON line on stdout and the same fields as a `kind:"jev"` row (decision 5). Exit code is always 0, unless the arguments are invalid (exit 2). The orchestrator reads `effective`.
   - *Applying a pick.* `effective = max(minimum, pick)` under the order haiku < sonnet < opus. `other`, low confidence, or any failure gives `effective = fallback default`. In `shadow` mode `effective` is always the fallback default and `applied` is false; the pick is only logged. The default of `--mode` in the script is `shadow`, so going live is a reviewed code diff.
   - *Confidence.* Jev's distribution is recorded as `conf` (probability of the pick). No threshold is applied in shadow mode; live thresholds are set from the bands that matched in shadow (Jev rule: shadow first).

4. **Fallback: the organism never blocks on Jev.** The fallback is exactly today's behavior: the cell's genome model (the minimum tier below) and full qa verify. It triggers on: no `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, network error, non-2xx, a 10 s timeout, unparseable answer, an input that matches a secret pattern from `scripts/risk-check.mjs` (`blocked-input`), or the daily cap. The row records the reason in `fallback`; the script prints it and still exits 0.

5. **Shadow-log row**, appended by `jev.mjs` to `.scratch/usage.jsonl`, one per call (including fallbacks):
   ```json
   {"kind":"jev","ts":"2026-09-29T01:20:00Z","ticket":"feature/NN-slug","point":"tier|verify",
    "pick":"sonnet|opus|light|full|other|null","actual":"sonnet|opus|light|full",
    "cost":0.0007,"conf":0.93,"mode":"shadow|live","fallback":null,"ms":112,"model":"jev-1.13.0"}
   ```
   The grill fixed `kind, ticket, point, pick, actual, cost`. `ts` is added because the cap (decision 6) sums today's rows. `conf`, `mode`, `fallback`, `ms`, `model` are added so the exit review can read bands, failures and latency without new instrumentation. `actual` is what the orchestrator will dispatch with (equal to the fallback default while in shadow). `cost` is `usage.cost` from Jev's response, or 0 when no call was made. Outcomes are not written here: the analysis joins on `ticket` to the existing `cell` rows (tokens) and `resolved` rows (bounces).

6. **Daily cap $0.50.** Before every call `jev.mjs` sums `cost` over `kind:"jev"` rows whose `ts` falls on today's UTC date. At or above $0.50 it makes no call, logs a row with `fallback:"cap"` and `cost:0`, and the relay runs on the minimum tiers and full verify. A single call is at most about $0.003 (64k tokens), so the cap is overshot by that much at most; the $0.50 cap is about 180 max-size calls.

7. **Minimum tiers per cell** (the genome model is the minimum; Jev may raise, never lower, except where noted; Jev only decides the two cells marked):

   | Cell | Minimum | Jev may raise to |
   |---|---|---|
   | orchestrator | opus | (not dispatched) |
   | product, architect | sonnet | never |
   | qa specify | sonnet | never |
   | developer | sonnet | opus (`tier`) |
   | qa verify, full | sonnet | never |
   | qa verify, light | **haiku** | never |
   | security | sonnet | never |
   | scout | haiku | never |
   | designer, debugger | opus | (not decided) |

   qa verify's *genome* stays `sonnet`; `light` is the one place a dispatch goes below the genome, per grill decision 9. `full` is the fallback, so a Jev failure can only cost tokens, never verification quality.

8. **Model override at dispatch.** The orchestrator passes the model explicitly on the dispatch call: the `Agent` tool's `model` parameter (`sonnet|opus|haiku`), which takes precedence over the agent definition's frontmatter. For a developer: `model` = `effective` from the `tier` call. For qa verify: `light` dispatches with `model: "haiku"` and a prompt line `verify depth: light`; `full` dispatches with `model: "sonnet"` and `verify depth: full`. A run from a terminal uses `claude --agent qa --model haiku`. Nothing edits a genome file. Applying this in the orchestrator genome, and defining light and full in the qa genome, is `.claude/` work behind the user's permission (follow-ups B and C).

9. **Data exposure** (for `security`). *Leaves the machine, to TypeSafe's API only:* ticket markdown and the developer's test output, truncated to 16k characters, plus the pinned model name. The user allowed source excerpts in the 2026-09-28 discussion; test output may carry excerpts through stack traces or assertion diffs, which is the only source that can leave. *Never leaves:* `.env` files, secrets, credentials, diffs, source files, transcripts, the board's locks, handoffs. `jev.mjs` reads the ticket and the `--tests` file only, and blocks the call (`blocked-input`) when the assembled text matches a `risk-check` secret pattern. *Key:* `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` in the user's own environment, set by the user. The script reads `process.env` only, never writes the key to a file, log or row, and never prints it. No cell creates an account or enters a key. *Local proxy:* not used; a proxy adds a process for one text stream that is already limited to two inputs. The user's earlier retention question stays open, since pricing and retention facts are from secondary sites (`security` should check TypeSafe's primary docs).

10. **Shadow mode and its exit.** Shadow runs on the next 5 code tickets, both points on each, with the old path deciding. Exit review = the orchestrator reports the numbers to the user; the user decides per point whether to go live. Go-live for a point needs all of:
    - *Coverage:* at least 5 tickets have a `jev` row at that point; fallbacks (not counting `cap`) are at most 1 in 5 and median `ms` is under 2000.
    - *Safety:* for `verify`, no ticket where Jev picked `light` had a finding or bounce at full verify or security that a light verify would have missed; for `tier`, no ticket where Jev picked `sonnet` bounced for a capability reason. The orchestrator judges each from the handoffs and lists them. One miss keeps the point in shadow for 5 more tickets, or ends the trial.
    - *Value:* the counterfactual (apply each pick to that ticket's `cell` token rows, weighted by tier as fixed before the results are read: haiku 0.5, sonnet 1, opus 2, the API price ratio of Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 5.5 and Opus 5.5 ($1/$2/$4 input, $5/$10/$20 output per MTok), fixed by the user on 2026-09-28; light verify is qa verify on haiku, full on sonnet) projects at least 30% fewer tokens per resolved ticket with unchanged bounces (grill decision 4), plus tickets resolved per 5-hour window no lower than the shadow baseline.
    - *Spend:* the daily cap never fired for a reason other than heavy use, and total `jev` cost per ticket stays under 1% of a ticket's plan usage.
    A point that fails value or safety stays off. A local-model comparison (RTX 3060 Ti, scope added 2026-09-27) becomes worth doing only if the Jev path fails on data exposure or cost; it replaces the resolved-ticket trial in ticket 04's second checkbox, which shadow mode supersedes with real, live tickets.

**Considered options.**
- *A Jev cell (an agent that calls Jev).* Rejected: a cell spends Claude tokens to decide whether to spend Claude tokens, and Jev's own cost is on API credits, so it should be called on demand.
- *Jev as an MCP server or skill.* Rejected: tool and skill descriptions cost context in every session, and the model would choose when to call it; the two call points are fixed, so code calls them.
- *One script per call point.* Rejected as shallow: cap, redaction, fallback and logging would be duplicated.
- *Jev may lower any tier.* Rejected (grill 2): an error cannot then break a cell that today works. Only qa light verify goes below its genome, and its fallback is full.
- *Jev also picks security depth.* Rejected (grill 3): `risk-check` is scripted and free.

**Consequences.**
- Test seam: the exported `decide({point, ticket, tests, now, usageRows, transport})` returns the result and row; the CLI is a thin wrapper. The one seam is `transport`: real `fetch` in production, a fake in tests (two adapters). Cap, redaction, fallback, `max(minimum, pick)` and row shape are tested through `decide`. Nothing else is mocked.
- The `kind:"jev"` row extends the `usage.jsonl` kinds listed in the orchestrator genome; the genome line changes only with the user's permission.
- `CONTEXT.md` terms proposed, not added (a brain gate): **minimum tier**, **shadow mode**, **verify depth**.
- Open, for the exit review: whether diff metadata may be an input; live confidence thresholds; the Jev SDK is Python only per the secondary notes, so follow-up A first checks whether the primary docs offer plain HTTP (no dependency) and otherwise asks the user before adding one.
- Follow-up tickets are proposed in ticket 04's Comments and are not published.

**Amendment 1 (2026-10-05, organism-infra/136, the user's go-live terms of 2026-10-04): trials replace shadow and exit review; tier is retuned before it goes live; verify's fallback is today's rule.** ADR 0019 decision 5 already amended decision 10 for `verify` (live) and `tier` (stays in shadow); this amendment follows it and goes further where noted. Per-use-case terms (start date, mode, inputs, measure, baseline, kill condition, confidence floor) live in `docs/jev-usecases.md`. Nothing here is live until the go-live ticket merges and writes each use case's `config` row.
- **Replaces decision 10** (shadow mode and its exit): there is no shadow-then-review step. A use case runs a **trial** of 10 resolved tickets on which it fired, then gets one keep-or-kill verdict from the user. One safety miss turns the use case off at once. The coverage, safety, value and spend bars are replaced by the measure and kill condition in the ledger. The weights stay: haiku 0.5, sonnet 1, opus 2. **Follows 0019 decision 5** (judged on outcomes: tokens per ticket and bounce rate against the 10 tickets before go-live) and extends it from `verify` to every use case on the list.
- **Replaces decision 3, "Confidence" bullet** (no threshold; set later from shadow bands): live picks below a floor fall back. The default floor is 0.8; per-point floors and reasons are in the ledger. `verify` uses 0.65 for `light` because 42 of 42 shadow `light` picks sat below 0.8 and a 0.8 floor would never apply one.
- **Replaces decision 4, verify's fallback.** The fallback is today's rule, not a fixed `full`: light when qa ran `specify` for the ticket, full otherwise (the floor of ticket 58 stays). Shadow mode's `effective` equals the same rule. This is the bug logged on 2026-10-05: `jev.mjs verify` in shadow with fallback `no-key` printed `effective: full` on a qa-specified ticket, because `POINTS.verify.fallback` is `"full"`. `tier`'s fallback stays the genome model.
- **Replaces decisions 1 and 7, and the considered option "Jev may lower any tier", for `tier` only.** The `tier` point may lower a developer to Haiku for a small ticket as well as raise to Opus (labels `small | standard | hard | other`, mapping to haiku, sonnet, opus). The genome model stays sonnet and remains the fallback. Lowering is allowed only on the developer and only to Haiku. A Haiku developer that bounces is a safety miss and turns lowering off (raising stays on trial). No other cell may go below its genome except qa light verify, as before.
- **Replaces decision 2's `tier` rubric and decision 3's `tier` question.** `hard` is tightened and `small` is added. The labels, rubric text and thresholds are re-derived from measured outcomes in the shadow rows, not by judgment: each resolved ticket with a developer `cell` row is labelled `small` (developer tokens in the lowest tercile and no bounce), `hard` (top tercile, or bounced for a capability reason read from the handoffs) or `standard`; the rubric uses only ticket features that separate those labels on the history (criteria count, modules named, lock or migration words); floors are the lowest value at which no picked-`small` ticket in the history bounced. The existing 49 resolved picks, for scale: Jev's `standard` picks (sonnet) had a median developer cost of about 61k tokens and 0 bounces in 19 tickets; its `hard` picks (opus) about 111k and 7 bounces in 30. The `small` label has no shadow data, so the retuned `tier` first runs in shadow on at least 10 tickets (this does not count as the trial), then re-derives its floors, then goes live under the trial. This is a separate ticket from the first go-live.
- **Replaces decision 3's "default of `--mode` is shadow, so going live is a reviewed code diff".** The code default stays `shadow`, but the mode of each use case comes from its latest `config` row in `usage.jsonl` (`mode: live|shadow|advisory|off`), so a keep, kill or rollback is an appended row, not a code change. `decide` already receives `usageRows`, so the seam is unchanged: the mode is resolved from rows passed in.
- **Unchanged:** decision 1's "not Jev's" list except as ADR 0015 changed it; decision 5's row shape (a `live` row gets no new fields; the config row is new); decision 6 (cap $0.50); decision 8's override mechanism; decision 9 (Data exposure: ticket text and test output only). The qa verify `light` dispatch on Haiku stays the one place a dispatch goes below the genome other than `tier`.
- **Conflicts surfaced, not resolved.** Listed once, for ADRs 0010 and 0015 together, at the end of ADR 0015 Amendment 2 (conflicts C1 to C7).
