`agents/` subfolders (other-tool metadata) were not copied.

| Skill | Status | Local changes |
|---|---|---|
| grilling, grill-me, grill-with-docs | as-is | none |
| domain-modeling, codebase-design | as-is | none |
| tdd, diagnosing-bugs, prototype, research | as-is | none |
| wayfinder, resolving-merge-conflicts, writing-for-agents | as-is | none |
| handoff | **adapted** | Model-invocable. Writes to the board (`.scratch/<feature>/handoffs/`) instead of the OS temp dir. Fixed sections, 60-line cap. |
| implement | **adapted** | Model-invocable. Claims the ticket via organism-protocol, delegates verbose output to `scout`, never merges, ends with /handoff. |
| to-tickets | **adapted** | Model-invocable (orchestrator). Step 4 is a brain gate. |
| to-spec | **adapted** | Model-invocable (product). |
| code-review | **adapted** | Adds a Pro token-budget note (sonnet sub-agents, diff command not pasted, current ticket only). |
| organism-protocol | **new** | Shared cell rules: board, claims, gates, apoptosis, token hygiene. |
| asset-critique | **new** | Visual critique rounds for rigged glb assets; `scripts/measure-glb.mjs` measures per-bone proportions. |
