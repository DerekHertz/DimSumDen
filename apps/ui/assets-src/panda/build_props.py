# Builds the three Brain-type habit props as small standalone meshes, each in its socket's local
# space (object origin (0,0,0) is the socket, at the paw's centre, so a runtime attach with an
# identity transform under the paw_L/paw_R/hat socket node puts it in the paw). Run inside
# Blender from the Python console or the Blender MCP:
#   exec(open(r"<repo>/apps/ui/assets-src/panda/build_props.py").read(), {"PANDA_SRC": r"<repo>/apps/ui/assets-src/panda"})

# artifact's tokens.json #674698 light / #c3a5f9 dark, hue ~264deg). The three props stay in that
# hue family, varied by lightness/saturation for shape-driven distinguishability rather than by
