// organism-infra/94: make the Den scene cheap in headless browser tests, without touching the app.
//
// Cause (measured, see handoffs/94-developer.md): headless Chromium has no GPU, so WebGL runs on SwiftShader, a CPU
// rasteriser. The scene is about 230 draw calls per frame and a frame costs 100-200 ms of main-thread time even at a
// 640x400 viewport, so the render loop pins the page at about 5 fps. On the 2-core CI runner that starves Playwright
// (a button click took about 4.5 s to land on 2 pinned cores, and 8-10 s with other work running: the click timeouts
// are 8-10 s), and every test boots its own page, so the file takes 15-50 s per test.
//
// Two levers, both applied through a page init script, so nothing in the app changes:
//  - skipDraws: draw calls become no-ops. The scene graph, React tree, raycasting (CPU) and every DOM node the tests
//    read are unchanged; only the pixels are never rasterised. Tests that need pixels or a real render (smoke --url,
//    station-hues-live) do not use this helper.
//  - frameDelayMs: each requestAnimationFrame callback is held back this long, so the render loop's JS leaves the
//    main thread idle between frames. The delay lives in the page's own world; Playwright's actionability checks run
//    in its utility world and are not slowed by it.

export const LIGHT_SCENE_DEFAULTS = { skipDraws: true, frameDelayMs: 100 };

// Runs inside the page (serialised by Playwright), so it must not close over anything.
