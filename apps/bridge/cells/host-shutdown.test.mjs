// organism-infra/140 (criterion 4): the bridge ends every child it started when it is signalled, exits, or crashes.
// ADR 0016 decision 2, process lifetime: a handler on SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP and uncaughtException runs the kill
// sequence (stdin close, grace, SIGTERM, grace, SIGKILL); the 'exit' event sends SIGKILL synchronously.
//
// These tests run host-shutdown-probe.mjs as a separate node process whose runtime wraps real OS children that
// ignore SIGTERM and stdin close, so only the escalation to SIGKILL can end them. The signal handlers belong to
// startBridge (the probe installs nothing itself) and close() removes them.
