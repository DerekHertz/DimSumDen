// organism-infra/143 (security finding 3): host.shutdown() must not wait without bound for a spawn in flight.
// With the real runtime a spawn can take a while (or hang); today shutdown() awaits every pending spawn first, so a
// SIGTERM during a slow spawn leaves the live agents running past the signal. The fix is a bound.
//
// PINNED INTERFACE: policy.mjs exports SHUTDOWN_SPAWN_WAIT_MS (a positive number); startBridge's `policy` accepts a
// test-only override `spawnWaitMs` (it can only lower the constant). shutdown() waits at most that long for in-flight
// spawns; past it, the live agents get the synchronous killAllSync path (first recorded call SIGKILL, no graceful
// steps), shutdown resolves, and a spawn that completes late is still terminated afterwards.
